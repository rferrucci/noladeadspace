# noladeadspace
noladeadspace.com is a re-design and development of a web site from the Historic Preservation Program at the University of Pennsylvania. 
The site detailed the famous St. Louis No. 1 cemetery in New Orleans, with history and information of New Orleans, her so-called "cities 
of the dead," as her cemeteries are called, and a wealth of other information on preservation. The site was specifically set up to 
showcase the work of a project called "Dead Space." Graduate students in the project systematically documented every tomb in the cemetery, 
with information on family name, tomb materials and types, and even some notable inhabitants. Needless to say, the site was designed in 
2002/2003 and looked like it, with shoddy graphics, poor navigations, and lousy use experience. I contacted the professor in charge and 
offered to re-design and develop the site and he gave me the green light. I actually built the site in Drupal so there is no much code 
here, but I did have to write some custom php and javascript/jquery code.
